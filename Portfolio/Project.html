            <h3>Color Reader Crabbe</h3>
            <p>Color Reader Crabbie is a mobile game that will test the user’s ability to multitask the comprehension and work of their brain. Crabbie will be controlled whether to go right or left, stepping on a colored tile. The game will flash a color name at the top of the screen and it will be in different font color which will confuse the user. The rule is simply read the color name and make Crabbie step on the colored tile based on what is read. The game will continue until the lives are empty.
